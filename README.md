# Crime-Prediction-using-Stock-Performance

The film ‘Minority Report’ was one of the first mainstream ventures to introduce the futuristic idea of ‘precrime’: the ability to predict crime before it occurs. Our project aims to convert this futuristic idea into reality in order to create safe public spaces for the world. While we have a general idea of ‘safe’ and ‘unsafe’ neighborhoods in every city, currently there is a lack of clear insights on the number of anticipated assaults in an area in a given period of time, how assaults are affected by seasonality, weather conditions, unemployment rates and the stock prices of local companies. In particular, in this project, we intend to explore the relationship between market sentiment and the number of assaults, and the types of psychological behaviors that cause this difference.

In this project, we explore the relationship between stock prices and the number of assaults in Boston. Since there is limited research on the relationship between stocks and assaults, we intend to build models that can improve crime prediction and resource allocation. Based on the existing challenges in public safety, we have identified the following objectives for this project:

- Analyze historical crime data for the city of Boston and identify patterns in assaults
- Research external datasets for potential crime predictors like seasonality, historical data, economic indicators, and stock prices of companies headquartered in Boston. 
- Develop Poisson models that can provide insights into heterogeneity in the number of assaults, along with a time-series-based crime prediction model.
- Public safety institutions can use our models to predict the number of assaults in the future, and allocate resources for crime prevention and medical emergencies.
